## Abstract

## Introduction

Online education has been accused of being a mere recycle of material originally created for in-person classes

## Method description

The motivation behind the stakeholder enactment educational methodology is to allow students to understand how others perceive him, and therefore gain insight on why they should learn the content they are about to learn. Take for example a course that is aimed at educating students on how to be proactivity. A traditional course would likely educate students on the information regarding proactivity, and if it takes a practice-based learning approach it would explain how to be a proactive person. However, what both methodologies do not approach is how others perceive the student if he/she acts in a proactive or non-proactive manner. In other words, non-proactive students are rarely aware of the extra workload they impose upon their co-workers and how potentially negative their co-workers' perception might be about them.

In the stakeholder enactment methodology this situation is reversed by asking the learner to enact a situation. To illustrate this situation, imagine a situation in a company where a novice programmer joins a software development team. This novice programmer is non-proactive, and therefore every time he has to take a new step that is unfamiliar to him, he will ask his boss rather than trying to identify the problem, search for a solution and attempt to implement it. If asked, this novice employer might consider himself as simply being extra-careful, but from his boss' perspective he might
