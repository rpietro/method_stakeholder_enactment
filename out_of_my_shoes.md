## Introduction

Online education has been accused of being a mere recycle of material originally created for in-person classes <!-- ref --> and much of that accusation is probably deserved. In other words, online learning rarely takes advantages of its unique environment characteristics, and instead attempts to imperfectly mimic what happens in an in-person environment. In this article we describe an online educational methodology that attempts to fill this gap, presenting a method that makes use of videos to help adult learners impersonate stakeholders who interact with them on certain activities, ultimately gaining insight about themselves from an external perspective. 

Specifically, the stakeholder enactment perspective merges two 

The article starts with a description of the learning methodology, then provides examples through scripts and videos, describes its implementation in a learning management system, and then discusses this method in face of previously existing scholarly literature.

## Method description

The motivation behind the stakeholder enactment educational methodology is to allow learners to understand how others perceive them, and therefore gain insight on why they should learn the content they are about to learn. 

Take for example a course that is aimed at educating learners on how to be proactive. A traditional course would likely tell learners what they should do in order to be proactive. If the instruction follows a practice-based learning approach, then it would provide exercises where that information would be applied to actual cases requiring proactivity. However, what both instructional methods do not approach how stakeholders of that activity perceive the learner if he/she acts in a proactive or non-proactive manner. In other words, non-proactive learners are rarely aware of the extra workload they impose upon their co-workers and how potentially negative their co-workers' perception might be about them, and although this information is essential in providing the motivation and insights into why it is important to be proactive, these aspects are lost in the process.

In the stakeholder enactment methodology this situation is reversed by asking the learner to enact a stakeholder who is part of real-life situations where the learned skills is to be applied. To illustrate this situation, imagine a company where a novice programmer joins a software development team. This novice programmer is non-proactive, and therefore every time he has to take a new step that is unfamiliar, he will ask his manager rather than trying to identify the problem, search for a solution and attempt to implement it. If asked, this novice employer might consider himself as simply being extra-careful, but from his boss' perspective he will likely be perceived as an extra-burden who is constantly bothering him and taking time aways from his multiple other duties. Being unaware of this highly negative perception, the novice employee simply continues to act in a non-proactive manner. 

How would this scenario be approached from an stakeholder enactment learning perspective in an online environment? Briefly, learners would go through the following steps:

1. Learns log into a learning management system and receive a briefly explanation saying that from that point on they are no longer themselves. Instead, they will be enacting their direct managers.
2. They are then told that one of their direct reports lacks proactivity, and that their role is to coach them into being a more proactive person.
3. Next, they watch a brief, classical screen casting lecture with support information on what it takes to be proactive. This lecture is followed by a couple short readings on proactivity
4. Learners, who are now enacting managers/coaches, watch a short video of a person they intend to help. In this video this person will present three behavior patterns. First, they will ask them for help in a situation where they could have been proactive (an faulty action). Second, they will present some characteristics that are considered proactive (a correct action). And third they will miss some opportunities to display proactive behavior (a missing action).
5. After watching this video, the learner will be presented with multiple alternative questions asking them to coach the person in the previous video by pointing to them which behavior patterns were are a display of proactivity (correct action) or that lacked such proactivity by either showing a non-proactive behavior (error) or simply failing to display it (a missing action)
6. This pattern of showing a video of a fictitious character and then asking them to provide feedback to that person is repeated multiple times.

The main point of this sequence is to provide learners with insights that can only be gained when they step into their stakeholders' shoes. In other word, non-proactive persons would gain much more insight into the burden they add to their work colleagues by enacting them than if they were simply told that they are a burden.

## Conclusion


Provide adults with insight from the perspective of the stakeholders mainly affected by the tasks they perform.
